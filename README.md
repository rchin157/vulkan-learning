# vulkan-learning
I wanted to learn a modern graphics library, Vulkan and c++ have been gaining traction in recent years and continues to be relatively popular currently (2023).
Initially I intent to follow the video tutorial series by Brendan Galea and may continue on with the official vulkan tutorial or other tutorial series afterwards.

## Notes
(February 27, 2023) Switched to mingw for compiling the project since Visual Studio 2019 seemed to be introducing strange Vulkan validation layer errors.
Likely related to differences with the msvc build tools optimizing or not optimizing something.

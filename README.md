# vulkan-learning
I wanted to learn a modern graphics library, Vulkan and c++ have been gaining traction in recent years and continues to be relatively popular currently (2023).
Initially I intent to follow the video tutorial series by Brendan Galea and may continue on with the official vulkan tutorial or other tutorial series afterwards.
